            Hey, did you known that YMCA was one of the first youth organisations to pioneer the detached youth work approach known today as "Street Work" back in 1844 on the streets of London?  Next time you see one of our street workers with their distinctive Street Team jackets why not tell them this fact and see how they can help you with advice and information on jobs, education and fun opportunities at your YMCA.  You can catch them during our youth club nights on Paisley High Street, Linwood, Johnstone and Ferguslie Park
